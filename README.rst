ruby-opendirectory
==================

What?
-----

A simplified wrapper for MacRuby_ client applications that want to deal
with information stored in OpenDirectory_ - the goal is to make user
management easier than dealing with raw OpenDirectory.

Why?
----

Because I need to manage user accounts, but the OD API makes my brain
hurt.
